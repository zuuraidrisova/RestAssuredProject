Day 15 (Day 10 of RestAssured)

We reviewed data driven test
We did some role based access control test (who can do what , who can not do what)
Learned how to reuse the RequestSpecification and ResponseSpecification
RequestSpecification requestSpec = given().somespecHere..... ; 

ResponseSpecification responseSpec = responsespecBuilderObject...... build() ; 

given()
        .spec(requestSpecGoesHere)
when()
        .get("/someEndPoint")
then()
        .spec(responseSpecGoesHere)
How to build ResponseSpecification object easily
ResponseSpecification responseSpec = expect().statusCode(200).contentType(ContentType.JSON) ; 
Practice what we learned with LibraryApp
We will use these 3 endpoints :

GET /dahsboard_status
GET /get_book_categories
GET /get_all_users
We want to save the Request spec for

setting the X-LIBRARY-TOKEN HEADER
ContentType Header
logging everything
We want to save the Response spec for

Status code of 200
ContentType Header is JSON
log every detail
Setting the Request and Response Specification at global level
Just like we set baseURI and basePath using the static fields of RestAssured class , we can do the same for requestSpecification and responseSpecification if we have common spec for our entire RestAssured tests.

RestAssured.baseURI = "some URL here"
RestAssured.basePath = "/some path here" ;
RestAssured.requestSpecification  = given()..somespec ;
RestAssured.responseSpecification = expect()..somespec ; 
Practice the De-Serialization using the same test
get the Map<String,Integer> object out of the response of GET /dashboard_stats

Solution :

Response response =  when().get(" /dashboard_stats").prettyPeek();
// here getMap method automatically converting String to number
// for the value data type `Integer` since it can be converted
Map<String,Integer> statMap = response.jsonPath().getMap("") ;
System.out.println("statMap = " + statMap);
get the List<Category> object from the response of GET /get_book_categories
Response response = when()
        .get("/get_book_categories");
List<Category> categoryList = response.jsonPath().getList("", Category.class) ;
System.out.println("categoryList = " + categoryList);
get the List<User> object from the response of GET /get_all_users
Response response =  when().get(" /get_all_users");
JsonPath jp = response.jsonPath();
List<User> allUserLst = jp.getList("", User.class) ;
System.out.println("allUserLst = " + allUserLst);
get List<Map<Integer,String> > object from the response of GET /get_book_categories
// Each category is being saved into Map object 
// And the JsonArray is being saved into the List
// Jackson data-bind take care of all the conversion where it can 
List< Map<Integer,String> > categoryMapList = response.jsonPath().getList("");
System.out.println("categoryMapList = " + categoryMapList);
hint : you will need to create 2 POJO class called Category , User;

Project Lombok : How to remove boiler plate code
Getters Setters
Constructors
toString method
and so on....
Using Project lombok is 2 step process is IntelliJ Idea

Make sure you have latest IntelliJ
Add dependency to your project
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
    <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
    <version>1.18.12</version>
</dependency>
Add A IntelliJ Plugin called Lombok from the Lombok Plugin Website
or IntelliJ Preference --search plugins --Marketplace-- Lombok as below

Intall it and restart the IDE to take affect. (Say yes to any pop-up)
How install plugin

Once you completed previous steps you can use all powerful Lombok annotations to remove boilerplate repetitive codes.

import lombok.*;

@Getter // This annotation will add getters for all fields
@Setter // This annotation will add setters for all fields
@AllArgsConstructor // will add constructor including all fields
@NoArgsConstructor // will add no argument constructor
@ToString // will add toString method for the class
public class Category {

    private String id;
    private String name;

}
Now you can directly use this Class to create object as if you have all required members you specified as below :

public class LombokTest {

    @Test
    public void test(){
        // Using 2 args constructor
        Category c1 = new Category("12","abc");
        System.out.println("c1 = " + c1);
        //c1 = Category(id=12, name=abc)
    }

}
How do you handle data issue in your automation ?
The challenges :
Dynamic data -- Type of data that changes often and can not be reused for next test.
Data is not sync between environment.
Data that exists in one environment does not exists in another and casue test failure.
What's your approach to handle them ?
If the data change often and you have access to DB
Query the database to get up to date data and feed the data to your test.
If you do not have access to DB but have access to API
Send the request to the endpoint that return your data and get the fields that you want using jsonPath.
If you do not have data : CREATE IT FIRST then use that new data for your test.
You may create it from the UI Directly if the flow is available.
If UI is not ready, but you have access to the API endpoint to create data, you may send POST request to add randomized data and use it for the test.
last option(probably you will never have access to) is , inject the data directly from the database, you may ask for DBA help if that's the option.
Example of getting the data from database to feed our API Test
Problem Set :

Assuming we just got several Spartan server IP addresses that we have DB acccess to.

We want to run a test on GET /spartans/{id}. Data is so dynamic and different by environment to envieonment. We are constantly getting 404 error because the data does not exists

Approach :

Since we know there are lots of data already exists, we just needed to pick the correct id, we decided to make a conneciton to the database and get the latest available data to run the test (also thought about getting random data each time.)

Steps :

Using utility to make a connection to Spartan Database and ran below query :
    SELECT * FROM SPARTANS ORDER BY SPARTAN_ID DESC ;
Using the utility method getRowMap(1) to get the first row as Map<String,String> and saved it as appropriate data type:
Map<String, String> firstRowMap = DB_Utility.getRowMap(1);
int id = Integer.parseInt(firstRowMap.get("SPARTAN_ID"));
String name = firstRowMap.get("NAME");
String gender = firstRowMap.get("GENDER");
long phone =Long.parseLong(firstRowMap.get("PHONE"));
Use the id to send the GET /spartans/{id} request using RestAssured.
    when().get("/spartans/{id}" , idFromDB )... ; 
use the name,gender,phone we got from the DB as expected result to validate the json response we got from the request.
    ...then()
        .log().all()
        .statusCode(200)
        .body("id",  is(idFromDB) )
        .body("name",  is(nameFromDB) )
        .body("gender", is(genderFromDB))
        // converting the phone to long to avoid error
        .body("phone.toLong()", is(phoneFromDB) ) ;
Switched the different IP Addresses to see if it still work.
Pending : Some IPs did not return any data so planning to create data any time SELECT count(*) FROM SPARTANS return 0;
As time went by , we realized when we read the latest data, it's always reading same data since no new data has been created for a while. so we decided to randomize the data we got by doint below
Map<String, String> firstRowMap = DB_Utility.getRowMap(RANDOM_ID_WITHIN_THE_RANGE);
Our range is from row 1 till the last row count. In order to get the last row count , we can call the utility method as below:

int rowCount = DB_Utility.getRowCount();
In order to get random row number between 1 to row count, we can use faker:

int randomRowNum = new Faker().number().numberBetween(1, rowCount) ;
Now when we call the method and we are passing random row number each time. Our test is more robust and practical.

Map<String, String> randomRowMap = DB_Utility.getRowMap(randomRowNum);
System.out.println("CURRENT ROW IS "+ randomRowNum);
System.out.println("CURRENT ROW DATA IS "+ randomRowMap);
Saving the data from Database for the test use:

int idFromDB        = Integer.parseInt( randomRowMap.get("SPARTAN_ID") );
String nameFromDB   = randomRowMap.get("NAME") ;
String genderFromDB = randomRowMap.get("GENDER") ;
long phoneFromDB    = Long.parseLong(randomRowMap.get("PHONE"));
Now we can take same rest assured action to make our test data and assertion dynamic in any environment that has data.

given()
        .log().uri().
when()
        .get("/spartans/{id}" , idFromDB ).
then()
        .log().all()
        .statusCode(200)
        .body("id",  is(idFromDB) )
        .body("name",  is(nameFromDB) )
        .body("gender", is(genderFromDB))
        .body("phone.toLong()", is(phoneFromDB) ) ;_``_
